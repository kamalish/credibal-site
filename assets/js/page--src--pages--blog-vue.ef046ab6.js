When donations are coming in, an organization is able to serve its mission and grow the number of people it impacts. When donor retention is high, an organization is able to worry less about fundraising and focus more on service and strategy.</p>\n<p>But that’s easier said than done. It’s hard to establish a reliable pipeline of contributions, and it’s difficult to retain existing donations — but not impossible.</p>\n<p>In fact, if your organization follows the right process, you can create a more stable system for donations to support your short-term objectives and build your long-term future. Here’s a look at 4 steps you can take to generate more giving and better donor retention.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Be Open About Your Needs</strong></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-449" src="https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-Open_Enrollment-Featured_Image-300x199.png" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-Open_Enrollment-Featured_Image-300x199.png 300w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-Open_Enrollment-Featured_Image-585x388.png 585w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-Open_Enrollment-Featured_Image.png 706w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>\n<p>Your non-profit should always focus on being open about its needs. Let your donors see your what you’re asking for in great detail, and always let them know how you’re doing and how you’re progressing toward goals.</p>\n<p>In short, it’s all about transparency.</p>\n<p>For example, if your non-profit focuses on education, demonstrate how a $50 donation will cover the cost of educating a child for six months, as well as how a $100 donation will cover the cost of educating a child for a full year. Donors find specific details behind your “ask” compelling. They see your honesty. They appreciate it. And they are more likely to give regularly in response to your transparency.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Send More Than Thank-You Notes</strong></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-450" src="https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-300x216.png" alt="" width="300" height="216" srcset="https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-300x216.png 300w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-768x553.png 768w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-1024x738.png 1024w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-585x421.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>\n<p>How do you communicate after a donation? Most non-profits send a thank-you message, either by email or direct mail. These thank-you notes are essential, but it’s important to go a step further.</p>\n<p>Think about it this way: A thank-you note is a closing communication. A donor makes a contribution, and you send a thank-you note. That’s the end of it — action and reaction. But that’s not at all what a non-profit needs to do with its donors. Yes, send a thank-you note, but also send other communications that keep the relationship open rather than closing it out.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Remain Engaged After Giving</strong></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-451" src="https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donation-website-300x201.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donation-website-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donation-website-768x514.jpeg 768w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donation-website-585x391.jpeg 585w, https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donation-website.jpeg 776w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>\n<p>What’s the best way to stay engaged after an initial donation? Consider sending status updates in addition to your thank-you notes. Use a customer relationship management tool or another donor communication system to set dates for these status updates. For example, consider sending status updates quarterly after the initial donation. Not only are these status updates important for creating a culture of transparency, they also serve as opportunities for your donors to give again.</p>\n<p>If you want your status updates to be effective, find ways to show how a donor’s money is being allocated to different accounts — and how each of those accounts makes a positive impact on your organization’s mission. Again, this promotes a culture of transparency — and it does wonders for inspiring past donors to contribute again.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Create a Platform for Repeat Donations</strong></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-452" src="https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/images.png" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></p>\n<p>The final step is this: You need the right platform for repeat donations. More specifically, you want a platform that makes repeat donations incredibly easy for the people supporting your organization. When it’s easy for your donors to give on a consistent basis, they are easier to retain — and the day-to-day operations of your organization become much more stable.</p>\n<p>Credibal: The Perfect Tool for More Giving and Greater Donor Retention</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that these 4 steps work in concert with each other. Trying to increase giving and donor retention while skipping some of the steps outlined above would be like trying to climb a ladder with missing rungs.</p>\n<p>At Credibal, we offer the perfect platform for non-profits that want to follow this 4-step process for more giving and greater donor retention. Our platform includes the following:</p>\n<p>• Tools for demonstrating your organization’s specific needs<br />\n• Communication capabilities that go beyond thank-you notes<br />\n• A system for staying engaged with donors long after their initial contributions<br />\n• An easy-to-use platform for regular, automated donations</p>\n<p>Are you ready to enhance your fundraising and increase donor retention? <a href="https://credibal.com/contact-us/">Get in touch</a> to learn more about how Credibal can help your non-profit.</p>\n'}},{node:{title:"Give back to your Donors",path:"/2018/10/08/sharing-data-with-donors/",excerpt:"<p>&#8220;So we will have to show our donors how we are spending their donations?&#8221; This is the question I get asked a lot whenever I’m talking to nonprofit professionals and explaining the concepts behind Credibal and how it helps nonprofits be more transparent with the donors.

It can actually be very liberating since the burden of proof has been lifted off of you.  And you are instantly marked as the &#8220;most effective nonprofit&#8221; by your donors.</p>\n<p>The benefits are endless.  And in process you forge stronger relationships with your donors.</p>\n<p><strong>Give something back to donors</strong></p>\n<p>When donors donate, they are motivated by and acting purely on their good intentions to do good.  They know that when they engage in such transactions there is nothing much awaiting them at the end other than a nice Thank you note.</p>\n<p>But what if nonprofits could change that and operate in the same way a retailer or a service based merchant does?  And <strong>Offer something valuable</strong> in return to donors.  This would drive the donor satisfaction through the roof and the likelihood of that donor giving again will rise significantly.</p>\n<p>Imagine that you walk into a grocery shop, pay for your groceries, and then walk out empty handed.  Then the only time you’d ever want to go back to the grocery shop is when you are really trying to help all the food suppliers and the management of the grocery store to stay in business.  You have no motivation other than your kind heartedness or maybe a relationship with the store manager who constantly but nicely asks you to come into the store and pay for groceries without taking them home.</p>\n<p>So what can nonprofits give back to donors?  Show them how the money was spent.</p>\n<p>This act not only raises nonprofit&#8217;s credibility but is also a cure to multitude of problems including retaining donors, avoiding donor fatigue, and simply keeping donors inspired and motivated to give again.</p>\n<p><strong>Show Donors the Impact their Donations have made</strong></p>\n<p>Sooner or later donors can ask to see how their donations were used or understand the impact they have been able to make especially if they are a major donor or have contributed large sums of money.</p>\n<p>When donors ask for this information, they may not like to go into the details and might be happy in observing the overall progress, but if that progress can be backed by metrics, numbers and real data, the whole picture becomes even more powerful.</p>\n<p><strong>Define a Selective Budget</strong></p>\n<p>While a nonprofit is gearing up for transparency – the good thing is that it can be <strong>scoped</strong>.</p>\n<p>Credibal allows nonprofits to be transparent with their donors while controlling how much and which level of information to share with donors.</p>\n<p>The basic building block of transparency is defining and sharing a Budget.</p>\n<p>Credibal allows nonprofits to raise funds by publishing their budgets.  A Budget clearly shows donors how the nonprofit intends to use the money and it can be displayed on any giving page on the website.</p>\n<p>Nonprofits can create separate budgets for anything — it can be for the entire organization, or it can be for a special Project, a Campaign, or an Event — thus narrowing down the scope of transparency.</p>\n<p>A Budget allows Credibal to organize and track all the money that is coming in and leaving the nonprofit.  It is also instrumental in scoping and limiting exposure to the outside world as nonprofits begin their journey towards transparency.</p>\n<p>Happy Fundraising!</p>\n"}},{node:{title:"How can nonprofits Achieve Transparency?",path:"/2018/08/02/how-can-nonprofits-achieve-transparency/",excerpt:"<p>And Raise More Funds with Credibal Transparency and the effectiveness of nonprofits and charitable organizations have been an important topic ever since they have been around.

Some of the brave ones may ponder over the financial documents or the IRS Form 990 filed by the nonprofit, the bottom line is that understanding the effectiveness of the nonprofit is a hard task and measuring the impact of a single donation is even harder.</p>\n<p><strong>So what is transparency in Nonprofits and why is it important? </strong></p>\n<p>Well this is an easy one.</p>\n<p>Transparency, as defined by Charity Navigator, is the ability of a nonprofit to share critical data with donors.</p>\n<p>We interpret this as the ability of the nonprofit to show the impact of a donation and the overall value derived from it.</p>\n<p>We engage in commerce all the time—from buying a small pack of gum to conducting large multi-billion dollar deals—and we are constantly looking for value and hoping to make good use of our money.</p>\n<p>Donors are no different.  Even though they may not be getting any service or tangible item in return, they need the satisfaction of knowing that they have made a difference and that they got a good value out of their donation.</p>\n<p>That value can be delivered to donors in shape of a sincere thank you note, and more importantly by showing them how their donation was used.</p>\n<p>The best form of gratitude is in being transparent.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s been happening in the Fundraising world so far?</strong></p>\n<p>We think that up until today the fundraising efforts have mostly been concentrated in the pre-giving phase where the donor is still deciding to donate.</p>\n<p>The other phase, which we believe is equally important, is the post-giving phase in which the donor has already made the donation.</p>\n<p>Most of the fundraising efforts focus on the pre-giving phase where a lot of marketing like activities take place with the intent of converting a contact into a donor.  There is an abundance of technical tools that help nonprofits in managing donors, and making it easy for them to donate.  So we are good there.</p>\n<p>But once the donation has been made and we enter the post-giving phase, there isn’t much help available to nonprofits in terms of keeping donors informed on their donation status, or showing them how their donation would possibly be used.</p>\n<p>We feel that the inability of nonprofits to share more information in the post-giving phase is the root cause behind a lot of issues such as donor fatigue, inability to attract and inspire donors, and retain donors.  It can also have adverse organizational effects on nonprofits such as staff attrition especially among the fundraising development managers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Typical Scenario</strong></p>\n<p>In a typical scenario we have a nonprofit that solicits for donations, and a donor who makes a donation.</p>\n<p>Once the donation has been made, the technology allows the nonprofit to send a few automated thank you notes and that’s about it.</p>\n<p>There is no easy, organized and a personalized way for the nonprofit to share more information with the donor and therefore the process comes to a dead-end.</p>\n<p>This creates a cycle where nonprofits keep soliciting for donations but donors don’t get anything in return, inducing a no end in sight, uninspiring, tiring, non-attractive situation for donors causing them to simply stop giving.</p>\n<p><strong>How can nonprofits achieve transparency?</strong></p>\n<p>Achieve Transparency is like Achieving Nirvana – the ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>There has been a lot of literature online from various quarters advising nonprofits on how to be more transparent to their donors.  While those suggestions are excellent and should continued to be practiced, they do operate at a higher level and require a lot of manual work on part of the nonprofit.  Consider a situation where a major-donor inquires about the impact of their donation.  This information would have to be collected and compiled manually and then presented after some time.  A request like this from a non major-donor would almost be impossible.</p>\n<p>So the method is to organize and build systems that go to these details and maintain this information.</p>\n<p>The steps to achieving transparency are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pass Control to Donors</li>\n<li>Give Donors the Visibility</li>\n<li>Share more Data with Donors</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s take a look at each of the steps individually.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Pass Control to Donors</strong></p>\n<p>As a first step, nonprofits can spell out their needs in the shape of a simple budget that is visible to donors on the giving page.</p>\n<p>The very act of defining a budget and then sharing it with donors kicks off the transparency process.  This presents the big picture to the donors.</p>\n<p>It allows them to see how the nonprofits will be spending their donation and essentially passes the control in their hands by allowing them to pick a category they want to donate to.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Give Donors the Visibility</strong></p>\n<p>To keep donors engaged and interested in the post-giving phase, they should have the visibility and instant access to information that show them at what stage in the nonprofit’s workflow their donation has reached?</p>\n<p>This is synonymous to tracking your shipping package with UPS or FedEx.  You get to know exactly where the package is and when it is arriving.</p>\n<p>In our system, Credibal, whenever a donation is made, it is assigned a unique tracking number.  Using this number, donors can view a detailed report on the current stage of donation and how/when/if it has already been used or not.</p>\n<p>The ability to track every single donation no matter how small or large in real-time and on-demand by donors through a dedicated donor-portal is a powerful transparency feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Sharing the data</strong></p>\n<p>The final step is to share the data or as we like to call it, “the proof is in the sharing of the data”.</p>\n<p>Now that the donor understands the needs of the nonprofit and is able to track the donation, comes the crucial part where nonprofits must and can share viable/tangible data that proves how the donation was actually used?</p>\n<p>The proof comes in the shape of financial transactions as well as receipts, images, or any other documents and information that nonprofit can share with the donor.</p>\n<p>Credibal goes above and beyond to show how the donations are spent by allowing nonprofits to share different types of data, including images, documents, receipts, and financial transactions, which are pulled directly from linked financial institutions such as credit card companies and banks.</p>\n"}},{node:{title:"Inspire your Donors",path:"/2017/12/07/inspire-your-donors/",excerpt:"<p>Today, is an exciting day for us here at Credibal.

We are also excited to finally open up our website and this blog through which we will bring you many wonderful tips and techniques that we have learned that will help you in raising lots of more funds.</p>\n<p>We built Credibal for you — the non-profits, the charitable causes, membership based organizations, and virtually anyone who raises funds or manages a constituency.</p>\n<p>The idea behind Credibal is simple. We want to show donors what happens to their money&nbsp;<strong>“after”</strong>&nbsp;they have made the donation?<br />\nMost of us have probably experienced this already where we receive tons of solicitations – over various digital channels – to donate but the tools behind these channels go silent in&nbsp;<em>post-giving phase</em>&nbsp;once the donation has been made. Other than a Thank You note there’s not much else they can share with donors. So if donors are really curious they only option they have is to visit the website of the non-profit/cause to which they donated, view their annual report, or if they are brave, pull the annual Form-990 from third party websites.</p>\n<p>With Credibal non-profits will be able to share more information in the post-giving phase such as, how the donation was exactly used? Credibal helps map every single donation, no matter how large or small, to the very specific financial transactions that it helped pay for. In addition, donors receive a Tracking Number every time they make a donation which they use anytime to track their gift. Much like the tracking of a shipping package.</p>\n<p>It has been proven that when non-profits share more information with their donors, they raise more funds. But when we add this level of personalization, it is simply inspiring.</p>\n<p>So stay tuned with us and we promise to help you raise more funds with much more ease.</p>\n<p>Happy Fundraising.</p>\n<p>Kamal<br />\nFounder, Credibal</p>\n'}}]},allWordPressAttachment:{edges:[{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/13546.jpg"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SEO-for-Non-Profit-Organizations.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/how-to-get-donations.jpg"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/training-elearning.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/images.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/donation-website.jpeg"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-Open_Enrollment-Featured_Image.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-blackIcon.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/190.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-04-at-11.40.48-PM.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen1.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/donationReport-1.jpg"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dtr-1.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/donationReport.jpg"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reportPanel-e1517806179225.jpg"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/reportImg-400x453.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/blackIcon.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/whiteIcon.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/credibalWhiteLogoBold.png"}},{node:{sourceUrl:"https://credibal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/credibalBlackLogoBold.png"}}]}},p=function(e){var t=e.options;t.__staticData?t.__staticData.data=s:(t.__staticData=i.a.observable({data:s}),t.computed=r({$static:function(){return t.__staticData.data}},t.computed))},h=Object(a.a)(n,(function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("Layout",[o("div",{staticClass:"space-4"},[o("div",{staticClass:"container"},[o("ul",e._l(e.$static.allWordPressPost.edges,(function(t){var n=t.node;return o("li",{key:n.id},[o("g-link",{attrs:{to:n.path}},[e._v(e._s(n.title))]),o("g-image",{attrs:{src:n.sourceUrl,width:"650",height:"400",fit:"contain"}}),o("p",[e._v(e._s(n.excerpt))])],1)})),0)])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);"function"==typeof p&&p(h);t.default=h.exports}}]);
